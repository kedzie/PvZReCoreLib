// The seed-chooser grid is a fixed 8-column x 7-or-8-row area (SeedChooserScreen.Has7Rows()) with
// no native scrolling or paging - vanilla plants already come close to filling it, and every
// custom plant on top eventually overflows the visible area entirely (rows exist in mChosenSeeds
// but nothing on screen reaches them). An earlier attempt hand-built a Unity ScrollRect from
// scratch to work around this and was reverted: it ran an unbounded scene-wide search every frame
// long after the seed chooser closed (severe perf regression), and even when it "worked" the
// overflow content was visible but never actually reachable by scrolling into view.
//
// This replaces that with paging instead of scrolling: only one page's worth of custom plants is
// ever present in the reactive models at a time, added/removed directly (see ForceRefresh in
// SeedChooserDataModelPatches.cs) - the same ClearNoDispose + UpdateEntries rebuild already used
// elsewhere in this codebase to get custom plants showing up in the first place, just windowed.
//
// Deliberately does NOT touch ChosenSeedState at all. mSeedState (SeedInChooser/SeedPacketHidden/
// etc.) is an existing, unrelated native mechanism - a plant can be legitimately hidden or grayed
// out for its own reasons (roof-only restrictions, not-yet-unlocked, and others), independent of
// which page it's on, and still needs to render normally (grayed, locked, whatever native
// decides) whenever it IS on the current page. An earlier version of this both overwrote
// mSeedState to force page membership AND used mSeedState as its own removal criterion - which
// stomped a real native SeedPacketHidden (a roof-restricted custom plant on a rooftop level) and
// made it disappear entirely instead of rendering however native code intended. Page membership
// is tracked independently instead (CurrentPageCustomTypes) and is the only thing paging ever
// decides.
//
// Next/previous buttons are cloned from AlmanacArchive's own "arrows" GameObject (found live via
// Resources.FindObjectsOfTypeAll, since the Almanac screen may not be currently instantiated) so
// this doesn't need to hand-build new button art - only AlmanacArchive's own onClick wiring is
// stripped and replaced with page-turn handlers.
